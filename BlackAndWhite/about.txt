Think of Ansel Adams' majestic black and white landscapes, and you can appreciate the power that's possible when you leave color behind. Use black and white (or monochrome, as it's also called) techniques to heighten drama and emotion in your photos, to give pictures a timeless quality

Contrast - the difference between the light and dark areas in a photo - is an essential part of black and white photography. There are three levels of contrast that you can experiment with when you shoot:

High contrast, which means striking white and black tones, heightens tension and adds drama to photos.

Normal contrast provides the most "realistic" image, with a balanced range of black, gray to white tones.

Low contrast keeps tones mostly in the mid-range, so there are lots of grays.

Many artists use black and white photography because it helps viewers focus on the subject and composition without the distraction of color.

Try shooting interesting patterns, textures or lines in nature. Details that are barely noticeable in color become more prominent and poetic.

From the mountains to your backyard, landscape shots look magnificent in black and white.
